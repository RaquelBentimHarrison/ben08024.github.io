<h1>ASL Consultant</h1>
<p> I walked into a Little Caesars pizza place one time and stood right behind this guy on 
the counter. I noticed that when the attendant asked what he'd like that the guy used hand 
gestures to ask for a pen and paper. Clearly he was deaf and mute and that was the only
way for him to communicate. I was embarassed that I had never realized before how much of
a daily strugle it must be for people like him to just go about life when so many people
aren't able to understand you or communicate back with you. </p>
<p> So I thought of a business idea: a consultant company offering sign language training\
to business and publis establishments to increase their accessibility to disabled individuals.
The employees would be trained in the basics signs and the business would become certified as
capable of attending to that population, thus increasing their pool of customers and potential
revenue. It'd also be great publicity for the business and it'd create a more inclusive society
in general when those employees eventually use their sign skills every where they go later in 
life. </p>
